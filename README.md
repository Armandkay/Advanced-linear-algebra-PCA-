### FORMATIVE ASSIGNMENT: ADVANCED LINEAR ALGEBRA (PCA)

This repository contains the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as part of the formative assignment for Advanced Linear Algebra. The assignment involves applying eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and covariance matrix concepts to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving variance.

## Assignment Overview

### Part 1: PCA Implementation
- Implement PCA from scratch by computing covariance, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
- Dynamically select the number of principal components based on explained variance.
- Optimize the implementation for performance and scalability with large datasets.
- Replace example data with `fuel_econ.csv` and compute the principal components.
- Ensure all code outputs (plots, data, results) are visible in the Colab notebook.

### Part 2: Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculation
- Compute the second and third eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors.
- Determine the importance of each eigenvalue as a percentage.
- Collaboration must be documented through a digital whiteboard (Miro, Jamboard, Microsoft Whiteboard, etc.).

## Submission Requirements
- A completed Colab notebook with PCA implementation and benchmarks.
- A shared Miro board (or equivalent) for handwritten eigenvalue proofs.
- Submit a GitHub repository link containing the notebook and references.
